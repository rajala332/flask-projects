A "bank application" can refer to either a customer's written request to a bank for a service (like opening an account) or a software application that allows users to perform banking tasks digitally. A customer's application typically includes personal information, the purpose of the request, and any necessary supporting documents. A banking software application is a system that offers various financial functions, often including account management, transactions, and security features, to meet customer needs remotely.
